/**
 * You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have
 * one candle for each year of her total age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be
 * able to blow out the tallest ones. Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.
 *
 * For example, if your niece is turning 4years old, and the cake will
 * have 4 candles of height 4, 4, 1, 3, she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since
 * the tallest candles are of height 4 and there are 2 such candles.
